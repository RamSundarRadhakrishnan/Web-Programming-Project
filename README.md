This repositiory contains the files I have created as part of working on my project for BCSE20E - Web Programming.
Currently, it features basic pages written in HTML, styled with CSS with some basic JavaScript for form validation/basic shopping cart functionality.

TODO:
1- Port to React
2- Use databases and advanced JS to create user accounts
3- Send email alerts on contact form submission
4- More advanced shopping cart functionality
